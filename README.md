# Polyrhythms Basic Project

This project is a web-based interactive application that demonstrates polyrhythmic patterns through synchronized audio and visual elements. Utilizing HTML and JavaScript, it allows users to experience and understand complex rhythmic structures by visualizing and hearing multiple rhythms played simultaneously.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Graphical representation of polyrhythmic patterns using moving balls or indicators.
- **Audio Playback**: Synchronized sound playback corresponding to each rhythm track.
- **Modular Design**: Separate JavaScript modules (`ball.js`, `sound.js`, `track.js`) for handling different aspects of the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushchauhan7/Polyrythms-Basic-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Polyrythms-Basic-Project
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to launch the application.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes the JavaScript modules.
- `ball.js`: Handles the creation and animation of visual elements representing beats.
- `sound.js`: Manages audio playback for different rhythm tracks.
- `track.js`: Defines the logic for individual rhythm tracks, including timing and synchronization.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Usage

Upon opening `index.html`, the application will display visual elements moving in patterns that represent different rhythms. Each visual element is synchronized with an audio beat, allowing users to both see and hear the polyrhythmic patterns.
